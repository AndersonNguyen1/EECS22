This PhotoLab project allows the user to upload images and apply various filters
to them. When approaching each challenge, I used for loops to process the 2d
arrays of pixels and used logical and mathimatical reasoning to transform the
pixels to the desired filter. I used nested loops to process 2d matrices because
it is efficient and clear. Although each function began in a similar fashion,
they varied in their approach to solve the problem and challenged me to think
critically.

Lab 3 was very similar to Lab 2 but the Makefile did give me trouble. 
I had to spend a lot of time thinking about the dependies of each
target and that helped me flesh out how to write this program.
The DIPs were slightly more challenging than Lab 2 but overall,
it was not too bad. The idea of a Makefile really does save time,
but there is a learning curve to it.

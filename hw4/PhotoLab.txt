Assignment #4

This lab tested our ability to work with dynamic image sizes and our ability to work with
pointers. I had to use malloc and free allocate space in memory to keep track of the pixel's
data. Converting our previous DIPs to this new form was definitely a challenge and requires 
a lot of caution because one change can break the whole code. The implementation of the new 
DIPs were hard and I found myself spending hours completing just one of them. Pointers are 
also a really cool but abstract concept and took me awhile to figure out.

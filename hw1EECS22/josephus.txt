Josephus Problem Explanation

My approach to this assignment was to make 2 arrays. One kept track of points of each
executioner and the other one kept track of who was alive. I looped through the array
of who was alive and for each person that was alive, I would find out who they needed
to kill next. When a person dies, I changed their status to dead and grant the other 
player a point. It loops until there is only 1 person alive. 

I used modulo in order to cycle the array. For example if 5 was the max # of people:
1%5 = 1 and 6%5 = 1 

we can see that any value greater than 5 will be mapped to a specific value under 5
so we won't go out of bounds of the array. This essentially links the end of the
array to the beginning of the array. 

Once that it all done, we have a complete program!
